# DMFabric - A Blockchain solution for Disaster Management

World has seen many crisis situations because of various kinds of natural disasters where victims have to leave their houses,  find necessary services to survive such as food, shelter, medical, transport. They often do not have necessary funds to avail these kind of services in these situations.
Governments, multiple organizations, volunteers provide their help or generally have necessary will to provide their help during these natural disasters but below mentioned issues limit these efforts.
- Lack of secure environment where all parties are verified and accountable
- Lack of trusted & transparent channel to prevent mismanagement of funds & services (so that there are no conflict scenarios with respect to these)
- Lack of necessary ecosystem where existing enterprise systems & channels are integrated esp. for service providers
- Lack of the real-time resident tracking information based on which rescue operations can be initiated.

DMFabric Application builds an ecosystem/network with combined use of multiple technology platforms available today and provides a technical solution we are looking for by addressing above mentioned problems related to Disaster Management

# Mobile & Web Application Platform
to provide single channel to access this ecosystem

# Blockchain Platform
It creates a secure, resilient, traceable, trusted and transparent business network for Disaster Management It facilitates effective communication and on time response for participants/ organizations during crisis situation. With Blockchain’s shared distributed ledger all transactions are logged on to the network. Service providers can connect to Blockchain network using their existing eco systems for publishing their services and communicate with other participants. Thus it provides a platform or ecosystem for disaster management and brings governance in system. Blockchain’s key characteristics help to establish a trusted & transparent environment for business where transactions can be settled faster and efficiently.

# Cloud Platform
for providing high availability, more security and scalability for this ecosystem

# Key Features –

# Front End Mobile & Web Application and Service API Interfaces
The DMFabric network provides one platform to connect the residents, service providers and funds providers ( their existing enterprise systems ) using APIs

# Payment Wallet
Once registered, system will activate a payment wallet for affected residents/victims. The fund providers and Government & Banks can add money to these wallets directly to provide more transparency in fund distribution. Then residents can use this wallet money to avail any paid services as and when needed.

This again provides an alternative and efficient way for payment during crisis situations instead of using cash or cards. A payment mechanism using VPA (Virtual Payment Address), UPI (Unified Payments Interface) and MPIN can be used for these payment wallets which will be convenient and secure.

# Single View 
The system will provide a single view for residents (who actually know ground reality than the Government) & service providers to help each other by connecting them in more structured way. They don’t need to rely on various social media platforms for information they need
